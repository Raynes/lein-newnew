# lein-newnew

This plugin provides the 'new' task for creating fresh project skeletons from Leiningen 2.x, but is usable from Leiningen 1.x as well.

It is extensible via templates and has a simple API for creating them. With this new task, you can create templates for any sort of project scaffolding you can imagine, as simple or complex as you like.

TEMPLATES! WOOT!

By default, it includes four templates: default, app, plugin, and template. 'default' is for libraries, the same as what Leiningen's old 'new' task spits out. 'app' is for applications, while 'plugin' generates a skeleton Leiningen plugin project. 'template' is a very meta template for creating new templates.


## Updates for version 0.3.8

Templates are a great way to prototype and to setup a project skeleton quickly. When leveraged with the flexibility of leiningen and the awesomeness of clojure.

Writing templates has been simplified. Now entire directories can be templated with ease! Although the previous templating system still work, new templates should be specified in the format described below.

Using a template is still the same. To use a template, eg, a 'blank-angular-website' template just type:

    lein new blank-angular-website my-new-website
    
then:

    cd my-new-website
    lein run

The blank website template can be seen at https://github.com/zcaudate/blank-angular-website. Note that the template contains angularjs files which also use the mustache syntax and would have been problematic to template in the earlier versions of lein-newnew. The layout of this template is very simple:

    /root
       /src
         /leiningen
           /new
             blank_angular_website.clj    <= template specification

       /resourcs
         /leiningen
           /new
             /blank_angular_website       <= template files
                ... all template files... (project.clj, src, resourcs, etc.)

       project.clj
       .gitignore

so if you were to write your own template 'my-awesome-template', the layout would look something very similar.

    /root
       /src
         /leiningen
           /new
             my_awesome_template.clj    <= template specification

       /resourcs
         /leiningen
           /new
             /my_awesome_template         <= template folder
                <all the template files>  <= template files

       project.clj
       .gitignore

Publishing the template is as easy as typing `lein install` to install the template it on your own path, or if you have `lein-clojars` already setup, type `lein push` for the whole world to be able to access it.


### The Specification
    
Every template needs this file. 

    /root
       /src
         /leiningen
           /new
             my_awesome_template.clj    <= template specification

This the the example specification. Note that the file is in `src/leiningen/new/my_awesome_template.clj`; it has a namespace of `leiningen.new.my-awesome-template` and it has one method `leiningen.new.my-awesome-template/my-awesome-template` within the namespace.

    (ns leiningen.new.my-awesome-template
      "Generate a basic application project."
      (:use [leiningen.newnew.templates :only [year project-name
                                            sanitize-ns name-to-path]]))
    (defn my-awesome-template
      "An application project template."
      [name]  
      {:template true     ;; must be true, to differentiate from old   templating system
       :data 
         {:raw-name name
          :name (project-name name)
          :namespace (sanitize-ns name)
          :nested-dirs (name-to-path name)
          :year (year)}
       :directives
         {:render-dirs [["" :except ["resources"]]]  
          ;; The render-dirs directive renders everything in the template directory except those in the /resources folder. Folder paths that have mustache templates are also rendered.
          :copy-dirs [["resources"]]
          ;; This is a directory copy that preserves mustaches
          }})  

Additional Directives are `make-files`, `new-dirs`, `copy-files` and `render-files`

If a directory needs to be copied/rendered to an alternative location, just add the location in the next entry of the vector

eg.

    :copy-dirs [["src" "src/clojure"]]

will copy all template files under `src` to `src/clojure` in the project directory. More sophisticated directives can be seen at https://github.com/zcaudate/newnew-test-template/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/newnew_test_template.clj

Future directives: `commands` (not yet implemented, will allow shell scripts to be executed)

         
### How Templating Works
 
When you type:

   lein new my-awesome-template my-new-project

Leiningen will look for the template in 3 places:
   - your current environment
   - your own maven repository
   - online in clojars
  
The template must be verified to exist. Once that is done, the jar file containing the template is found.

 leiningen will then generate the template specification and them pass the specification in to the `render-project` function, which will render the template files as directed by the specification.



## Writing Templates

Suppose you've written a fabulously popular library, used the world
over by adoring fans. For the purposes of this document, let's say
this library is called "liquid-cool". If using liquid-cool takes a bit
of setup, or if you'd just like to give your users a little guidance
on how one might best create a new project which uses liquid-cool, you
might want to provide a template for it (just like how `lein` (via
lein-newnew) already provides built-in templates for "app", "plugin",
and so on).

Let's assume your library's project dir is ~/dev/liquid-cool. Create a
template for it like so:

    cd ~/dev
    lein new template liquid-cool --to-dir liquid-cool-template

Note that you'll now have a new and separate project named
"liquid-cool-template". It will have a group-id of "liquid-cool", and
an artifact-id of "lein-template".

> All lein templates have an artifact-id of "lein-template", and are
> differentiated by their group-id, which always should match the
> project for which they provide a template.

The files that your template will provide to users are in
src/leiningen/new/liquid_cool. lein-newnew starts you off with just
one, named "foo.clj". You can see it referenced in
src/leiningen/new/liquid_cool.clj, right underneath the "`->files
data`" line.

You can delete foo.clj if you like (and it's corresponding line in
liquid-cool.clj), and start populating that
src/leiningen/new/liquid_cool directory with the files you wish to be
part of your template. For everything you add, make sure the
liquid-cool.clj file receives corresponding entries in that `->files`
call. For examples to follow, have a look inside [the \*.clj files for
the built-in
templates](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-newnew/tree/master/src/leiningen/new).

While developing a template, if you're in the template project
lein-newnew will pick it up and you'll be able to test it. However, if
you want to use it on your system without putting it on clojars, just
`lein install` your template. If you're using Leiningen 1.x, do `lein
plugin install mytemplate 0.1.0`; on Leiningen 2.x it will be
available automatically.

### Distributing your template

Templates are just maven artifacts. Particularly, they need only be on the classpath when 'lein new' is called. So, as an awesome side-effect, you can just put your templates in a jar and toss them on clojars and have people install them like normal Leiningen plugins.

In Leiningen 2.x, templates get dynamically fetched if they're not found. So for instance `lein new heroku myproject` will find the latest version of the `heroku/lein-template` project from Clojars and use that.

## Usage in Leiningen 1.x

    $ lein plugin install lein-newnew 0.2.6
    $ lein new foo
    $ lein new plugin lein-foo
    
This plugin **requires** Leiningen 1.6.2 or later. Please confirm that you have this version by running `lein version` before installing the plugin. If you install the plugin on an older version (not sure how old it has to be to cause problems), you'll probably need to uninstall the plugin and then reinstall it after upgrading.

## Usage in Leiningen 2.x

You can pull in a newer version of this plugin than the one that comes with Leiningen 2 if you like; just add it to the `:plugins` section of your `:user` profile in ~/.lein/profiles.clj:

```clj
{:user {:plugins [[lein-newnew "0.3.4"]]}}
```
